# copycookies chrome extension
Copy all cookies used in the current tab to the clipboard.

This extension can be called by the shortcut key `Ctrl+Shift+K`.
It works as like as the export feature of the [EditThisCookie](http://editthiscookie.com/).
The copied cookie objects can be used by [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer).
